"""
Arkon MCP Server — exposes Knowledge Base tools to Claude.

This module creates a FastMCP server that can be mounted into the
main FastAPI app. Claude Desktop connects to /mcp and receives
tools to search knowledge, retrieve documents, list categories, etc.

Architecture:
    Claude Desktop → MCP (HTTPS) → /mcp endpoint → Arkon KB tools
                                                   → PostgreSQL (pgvector)
                                                   → Neo4j (graph)
                                                   → MinIO (files)

Connection:
    Employee runs: arkon connect --server https://ai.company.internal --token <token>
    This adds to Claude Desktop config:
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "arkon": {
                "url": "https://ai.company.internal/mcp",
                "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}
            }
        }
    }
